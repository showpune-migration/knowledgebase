## Integrate Azure Dependency Management in Project

To integrate Azure dependency management into your project, you need to add a new `` section in your project's build configuration file. This section will manage Azure dependencies by importing the `spring-cloud-azure-dependencies` with a specified version. This ensures compatibility and helps manage transitive dependencies effectively.

Here is how you can implement this change:

1. Locate the build configuration file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven projects).
2. Add the following `` section if it does not already exist:

```

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>5.17.1</version>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

```

This addition will help manage Azure-related dependencies in a structured manner, ensuring that all Azure components used in the project are compatible with each other.
