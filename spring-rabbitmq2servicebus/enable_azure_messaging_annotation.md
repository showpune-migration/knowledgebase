## Integrate Azure Messaging Support via Annotation

To enable Azure messaging features in your application, add the `@EnableAzureMessaging` annotation to the relevant class. Ensure that the annotation is correctly imported from the Azure Spring Messaging library. This change will configure the class to support Azure messaging functionalities.

Example:

```

// Before
@Service

// After
@EnableAzureMessaging
@Service

```
